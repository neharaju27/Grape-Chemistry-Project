## 📌 Overview

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze the wine quality dataset. The dashboard provides insights into the chemical composition of wines and their impact on quality scores. It includes various dynamic visualizations, key performance indicators, and interactive elements to explore relationships between different wine attributes.

## 📊 Features

### 🔍 Data Analysis & Visualization

- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Graphs and charts representing relationships between wine attributes such as acidity, alcohol content, residual sugar, and overall wine quality.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmaps and scatter plots showing the impact of different factors on wine quality.
- **Key Metrics**: KPI cards displaying crucial insights such as average acidity, alcohol content, and sugar levels.

### 🎛️ Interactivity & User Experience

- **Slicers and Filters**: Users can filter by wine type, quality score, or specific attributes for detailed analysis.
- **Hover Tooltips**: Provides additional details on data points when hovering over visualizations.
- **Drill-through Pages**: Allows in-depth exploration of specific aspects like acidity levels, sugar impact, or alcohol concentration.
- **Custom Theme & Styling**: Designed with  colors to create an elegant and intuitive interface.

### 📈 Data Processing

- **Python Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the raw dataset in a Jupyter Notebook.
- **SQL Queries for Data Extraction**: Structured queries to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data efficiently.

## 📁 Project Files

- 📂 **`Wines Project Python.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook containing Python scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
- 📂 **`Wines project.sql`** – SQL scripts to extract, process, and structure the dataset for visualization.
